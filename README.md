# Logistic Regression with digits dataset

## 📖 Description

This project classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using Logistic Regression on the Digits dataset.

## 🧠 Model Explanation

Logistic Regression is a linear classification algorithm used for binary or multiclass classification using the sigmoid function.

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a binary outcome — meaning, it predicts whether something is yes or no, true or false, 0 or 1, etc.

Examples:

Will a customer buy the product? (Yes/No)

🎯 When to Use Logistic Regression?

Your target variable is binary (e.g., Yes/No).

You want a probability output (e.g., "There's a 78% chance the customer will buy").

You want something simple and explainable.


## ✅ Benefits

Interpretable and simple

Efficient for binary and multiclass problems

## ⚠️ Limitations

Assumes linear decision boundary

Performance decreases with complex patterns
